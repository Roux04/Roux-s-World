# Roux-s-World
This was a challenge provided by Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Dev Course on Udemy!
A simple 1 page personal website; it contains multiple sections, including my languages, links to other projects, and contact. This project displays my growth as a software developer, especially with the advanced CSS I applied to the website.
